# Kingdom
University project made by [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/), Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia students of the TTC (Talent Tech Center) in Barcelona, in which we made a 3D Game Engine in C & C++ during our 3rd year of Game Development Bachelor's Degree.
This is our Kingdom, and we reign over it.

## Authors
* [Jonathan Cacay Llanes](https://github.com/xGauss05)
* [Ethan Mart√≠n Parra](https://github.com/Ethanm-0371)

## Features
* Functional UI, Window, Renderer, Input and System settings
* Creates empty GameObjects, Cube, Cone, Pyramid...
* Able to Drag and Drop .fbx, .png and .dds files
* FPS-like camera
* Able to Raycast and Mouse Picking. Selects the corresponding GameObject
* Saves scene as *.mdng* (json file)
* Saves meshes as *.mesh* (binary file)
* Saves materials as *.dds*
* File Explorer that reads Assets/, Library/, Scripts/. Can delete files.
* In engine script editor to edit .cs files.

## High Level sub-system
In our Kingdom, the Game Engine offers a Scripting System with the help of mono. It allows using .cs script files to manage GameObject behaviors. *todo*
